This example illustrates client-side unit testing using Jasmine.  It also 
demonstrates some of the issues with testing client-side javaScript.  In
particular, it shows the problem of adding fixture elements to the DOM
for tests after the initial page load has been completed.  In this very
common case, jQuery "setup" functions, run at the completion of page load,
will run before the fixture elements are added to the DOM. In this case, the
click handler attached to the a-elements of the movies table by the setup
function will not be attached to the fixture a-element added to the DOM in the
test of the AJAX call functonality.  The example shows a very kludgy work-around
for this problem.

The example also loads the fixtures in a rather kludgy way by specifying the
html in-line in the test.  This is not the best way to do it, but I have been
unable to get loadFixtures() to work properly--probably a path issue.  If you
figure out how get loadFixtures() to work, please let me know.


Note:  This repo does not include the:
config/initializers/omniauth.rb
file that contains the client key and client secret for twitter and github.

Before running this example, you will need to authorize the app for twitter
and github sign-in and create the omniauth.rb file containing the keys and
secrets obtained during the authorization process.  See the lecture slides for
the format of this file.
